# CjBlog - Joomla! Blogging Platform
CjBlog is a free Joomla! component for creating awesome community blogs

* CjBlog is a community blogging software for JoomlaÂ®. That means it can be useful on websites where you need community participation in creating content. For a personal blogging website for your own needs, CjBlog is not a recommended software. For personal blogs, Wordpress does more than you need.
* CjBlog provides all means of encouragement to the community participants in the form of points, badges, personal blog page for each user, personal profile page, user avatars etc. Again, these features are overshoot for a one person personal blog.
* CjBlog does not create articles on its own database tables, rather uses Joomla articles system. We believe there is no point in re-inventing the whole wheel. Joomla articles system is well tested by thousands of volunteers and is extremely stable. So we choose it to power CjBlog. 
* CjBlog is not just confined to blogging, but can also be extended to the whole website echo system. with the powerful tools such as avatars, points system, badges, user profiles, it can be well suitable for a community website. A separate document for API is available for integrating CjBlog with third party extensions.
